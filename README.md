## PySnake üêç

PySnake is a classic Snake game implemented in Python. Navigate the snake with arrow keys to collect food, grow longer, and avoid collisions with the walls and yourself. A fun, lightweight project to enjoy or expand upon!

### Features
- **Responsive Controls:** Smooth and intuitive arrow-key navigation.
- **Dynamic Gameplay:** Snake grows longer with every piece of food.
- **Customizable:** Easily modify the grid size, speed, and more.
- **Classic Feel:** Nostalgic gameplay reminiscent of retro Snake games.

### How It Works
1. **Objective:** Guide the snake to eat the food while avoiding crashes with walls and itself.
2. **Controls:** Use the arrow keys (`‚Üë`, `‚Üì`, `‚Üê`, `‚Üí`) to move the snake.
3. **Scoring:** Earn points for each piece of food consumed. How long can you grow?

### Possible Future Improvements 
- Add levels or speed increases as the game progresses.
- Include additional obstacles or power-ups.
- Implement a leaderboard for high scores.
